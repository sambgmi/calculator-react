calculator-react
Description:
Built a basic calculator application that can
perform simple arithmetic operations like addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Implementation:
1. Created React components for the calculator interface,
number, and operation buttons.
2. Used React state (useState hook) to manage the
input and output of the calculator.
3. Implemented event handlers for button clicks to update
the input and perform calculations.
4. Styled the calculator using CSS for a user-friendly
interface.
